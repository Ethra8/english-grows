## AGILE METHODOLOGY
This project has been development with the Agile development method in mind, although at times, it might not have fully followed the methodology to a full extent.
- [User stories](#user-stories) have been created and implemented one at a time, and have been labelled following the **MoSCoW priorization logic**: ***Must*** & ***Should*** have. Future features have been, and will be, created following the same logic, adding ***Could*** and ***Won't/Wish*** labels.  
- Keeping in line with the Agile development methodology, a Kanban board has been created, and used to track user sttories, and bugs during development: [Kanban Project](https://github.com/users/Ethra8/projects/7)

All th data models of the site can be found in [this Googlesheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jID6FXBd1tZINHULIWNXjc0iRhyYGC6ce3y9dMppRVg/edit?gid=956386076#gid=956386076)

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3de7eae-a040-46be-adef-095ce6ff703d)
  
- To create an instance of the **Order** model, the user must be authentified. The **OrderLineItem** links to the **Order** model, as it is the latter which includes the services
    
  
#### HOME App - Models
This app has been created to store the home page *index.html* template, views and urls. For simplicity sake, the model that store data from the ***Companies*** section form has also been included in this app. Should the companies' section be widenned in the future, an independent app would be created to store this model and the subsequent templates, urls, and views.  
This app contains 2 forms, whose data is stored, and CRUD can be performed from the admin panel by an authorized user:  
  
- The **B2B Contact Form** takes user input in the *companies page* form, and posts the user request from CompanyContactform model, passing data to CompanyContact model whihc takes all the data and is registered to the admin model.
- The **Subcribe Form** only takes the name and email of any user, and stores it to create marketing campaigns, more specifically, emailing campaings. The data is reflected in the admin.
- The **EmailTemplate** model allows authorized users to perform CRUD functionality, to create email templates for marketing campaigns.
- The function send_email_campaign in the utils file is included in the options dropdown of the Email Template model in the admin panel.
- To conduct a marketing campaign (emailing), the authorized user only has to create or edit an existing email template, then save it, select it, select the option *send email campaign* on the dropdown, click on ***go***, and the email template selected is automatically and instantly sent to all subscribers.

## DESIGN CHOICES
The design of this site has been thought to reflect professionality and inspire trust.
  
### HERO IMAGE
The following image has been created to be the hero image. The globe is the same as in the logo, and has been selected to represent both the global reach that online classes have, and the global importance of English as a *lingua franca*. Three small birds have been included to the image, to represent the *freedom* that learning English can bring to people (traveling, business, etc.), the *communication capability* boost, and all three form a small group, to represent the small group learning format offered. The colours of the hero image match the look and feel of the site, also in harmony with the logo.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8a08d0d-a9bb-43d8-a56f-7c3d1467d481)

  
### COLOUR PALETTE
This is the palette used, contrasting with white fonts on darker backgrounds. Blue tones are proven to foster a state of relaxation and wellbeeing, optimal for the learning process:
  
![English Grows color palette](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4736fe3-98b4-4a52-9692-04e88e3bf1f9)  

  
### TYPOGRAPHY
The following fonts have been used, all from Google Fonts:
- **Montserrat**: Used for all main text in the site, the header and subheader of the *For Companies* page, and the alert messages.
- **Big Shoulders Display**: On the main heading of the landing page for the title *English Grows*, to match the logo styling, as well as for the other pages headings  
- **Charmonman**: Used for the landing page's subheading/slogan, and for the services page's part of the heading that says'for you', to match the logo styling

## CRUD Functionalities
### Admin Console - CRUD Funtionalities
The admin console reflects most of the models present in this site, and also some features from django-allauth module's user model. Authorized users (admin *superusers*) can ***create***,***read***,***update*** and ***delete*** ***(CRUD)*** any data model from the admin panel. Therefore, admin users with the necessary permissions can perform full CRUD functionalities on the following data models stored in its postgreSQL database: 
  
  * Services
  * Types of Services
  * Users
  * User Profiles (profile model)
  * Contact Requests (via B2B contact form)
  * Orders

    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e291b79f-118a-4056-ae2d-e5ee263cc1b6)  
  
#### Accounts
From django User model, stores **registered users' emails** for future emailing campaigns.
 
#### Profile
 * After each user is created, a profile is automatically created as well, and is stored in the admin. The user can update their information through their 'profile', but the admin can  also update each user profile manually:  
   
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43a9c341-bb08-45b7-9bf9-5f1438f3840c)  
    
#### Home
As the contact form on the 'For Companies' page is stored in the *home* app, this model has been created to store the contact requests sent by the users:  
 
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2be02964-8be9-42c6-aedc-91b253e51f93)  
 
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/648e5c59-0485-4ca1-92f7-16c2387e79e5)  
   
### Checkout
The orders created by the Order model are stored in the database, and reflected in the admin panel:  
  
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27bff2b5-0fdf-49f3-a2c0-b235e22f4017)  
  
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fee8e06e-3b76-4baf-a081-373f9f13976f)  

 
### Services - CRUD
 * To improve UX and the overall UI, authorized users (admin *superusers*) can ***create***,***read***,***update*** and ***delete*** ***(CRUD)*** the data model for Individual Services, including the service image, directly through the site without need to enter the lesser user-friendly admin panel. Thus, **Services can be created, read, updated, or/and deleted** through the main service page in the site:

## Navigation Bar
There are two navigation bars and both are fully responsive:
1. The first, ***topnav***, is fixed to the top of each page in the site, including the 404 error page, for an improved UX. It has a dark blue *#003366* background color, with white font and icons. It contains the logo on the left, which links to the home page, and two icons taken from [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/):
  * [**user icon**](https://fontawesome.com/icons/user?f=classic&s=solid): Has a ***dropdown*** menu whose options link to the user's ***profile*** (when signed in) and ***logout*** (when signed in, ***login*** if logged out). When the user is logged in, the user name displays below the icon.
  * [**bag icon**](https://fontawesome.com/icons/bag-shopping?f=classic&s=solid): Links to the shopping bag. Below the icon, the total amount of items stored in the bag is displayed.
2. The second, ***nav***, is only present in the individual services page, accessed through the *For You* button on the home page. It has a search bar to search for specific words within all the services names and descriptions.  
  
  https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71ea8143-fb09-4948-8eb5-bf2eeeb86a10

* [ ] **WISH**: As an **admin user**, I want to **include additional fields in the user profile**, in order to be able to **track students' progress**.
* [ ] **WISH**: As an **admin user**, I want to **receive an email each time a B2B user sends a request via the contact form**, in order to be able to **easily keep track of incomming requests**.
* [ ] **WISH**: As an **B2B user**, I want to **receive a copy of the request made via the contact form**, in order to be able to **have a reminder of my request**.

### JS ES6
The validation of the code has been successful. The validator used has been [JShint](https://jshint.com/). In order to remove inaccurate warnings related solely to the fact that it by itself does not support JS ES6, I [found the helpful and easy way](https://teamtreehouse.com/community/why-does-jshint-give-me-these-warnings-about-es6#:~:text=By%20default%2C%20JSHint%20gives%20you%20warnings%20if%20you%20use%20new%20ES6%20features) to make the tool read and analyse the ES6 code effectively, by simply adding this comment to the top of the code:  
```// jshint esversion: 6```  
  
- [**checkout/static/checkout/js/stripe_elementss.js**](https://english-grows1.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/checkout/js/stripe_elements.js) - Initial errors fixed:
  * JShint was not recognizing $ JQuery, so I click on 'CONFIGURE' at the top, and activate JQuery.
  * JSHint was flagging Stripe as an undefined variable because it didn't know that Stripe is defined in the Stripe.js library, which is loaded externally. To fix this in JSHint, I declared Stripe as a global variable by adding a JSHint directive at the top of the file. This way, JSHint understands that Stripe is expected to be available globally:
    ```/* global Stripe */```

# DEPLOYMENT
## VERSION CONTROL
The site was created using Gitpod editor and pushed to Github to the remote repository **‘english-grows**.  
The following git commands were given to the terminal throughout development to push updated code to the remote repo on Github:
1. ```git add .``` - Command to add the updated file(s) to the staging area before they are committed to the *main branch*, represented by a '**.**'.
2. ```git commit -m “commit text”``` - Command to commit changes to the local repository queue ready for the final push.
3. ```git push``` - Command to push all updated code to the remote repository on Github.
4. ```python3 manage.py runserver``` - Command to run **python** app on local server.

### REQUIREMENTS
- Make sure all the modules and requirements have been correctly installed by:
    * Install the necessary modules with command:
      ```pip3 install module```
    * Make sure you install versions that are compatible, to avoid system issues. Check the requirements file in this repository for surther reference, and type the command on the terminal:
      ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
  
### SECRETS
**WARNING - DATA PROTECTION** To avoid pushing sensible credentials stores in variables (e.g.: DATABASE_URL, SECRET_KEY) to Github:
1. Create an ***env.py*** file on the main directory of the app.
2. Ensure that env.py is included in the ***.gitignore*** file.
3. To include secret variables on the env.py file:
   - (i) On the top of the file, include the imports:
   -```import os
       from pathlib import Path```
   - (ii) Include eac hsecret var following this example:
   - ```os.environ.setdefault('DATABASE_URL', 'your-data-base-url')```
   - (iii) Import Operational System to your ***settings.py***, so it can access the system variables secretly stored in your env.py file:
   - ```import os```
   - (iv) To access the system variables in your settings.py file, use the following method to store them in other safe variables:
   - ```DATABASE_URL = os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL")```
4. BEFORE COMMITTING TO GITHUB:
   - On the terminal, type ```git add .```, then ```git status``` and make sure the env.py file is not in the list. Once you are reassured that it is not in the list of files to be committed, safely commit.

## HEROKU
### App Preparation
1. Create and add the **'Procfile'** to the root directory of the app, and include ```web: gunicorn candlelight.wsgi --log-file -```  Heroku relies on this file to determine how to run your application, ensuring the correct setup of your web server. Use commands like ```web: gunicorn PROJECT_NAME.wsgi``` in the 'Procfile' to instruct Heroku on starting your web server with Gunicorn.
2. If you haven't done so yet, create a ***requirements.txt*** file to store necessary modules and libraries:
   - ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
3. Ensure you have updated the ***requirements.txt*** file listing all project dependencies. The comnmand to update the file is ```pip3 freeze > requirements.txt```
4. Set up necessary **configuration variables** in Heroku ***setting tab > Config Vars*** *(eg. SECRET_KEY, DATABASE_URL, etc.)*.
5. Add Heroku to your ALLOWED_HOSTS in your app's *'settings.py'* file: ```candlelight-worlds.herokuapp.com```.
   
### Create Heroku App
1. Sign up to an account on [Heroku](https://heroku.com)
2. Create new app. Remember that app name must be unique on the whole of Heroku site.
3. Store all the secret environment variables (secret keys) on **settings** > **Config Vars**:
### Deployment Method
1. Ensure that in your **settings.py**, ```DEBUG = False``` before doing the last commit to Github before deploying to Heroku.
2. **On Heroku**, click the **deploy** tab on the top navigation bar.
3. Scroll down and select Github as 'Deployment method'
4. Use the github link and type in the name of your repository
5. Scroll down, to **'Manual Deploy'** configuration and select ***main*** on the dropdown for the ***branch the deploy***
6. Then click on **deploy from branch**
7. Once the app is loaded, click on the 'View' button that appears only then.
8. Once your application is running, you can switch to **Automatic Deploys** so that any changes in the repositori are automatically reflected in Heroku deployed app.
